## 1. Project Overview

Empower Your Core is a production-grade website for a premium Pilates studio in Utrecht, Netherlands. The architecture combines **Framer** (visual design layer) with **Next.js 15** (server rendering, routing, API) to deliver a fast, bilingual, pixel-perfect experience.

In this English handover repo, the homepage's main premium sections are already baked into `public/index.html` so they do not have to be rebuilt entirely at runtime.

**Key stats:**
- 4,700+ lines in the runtime engine (`translate.js`)
- 14 pages (homepage, 6 case studies, pricing, contact, method, training, about)
- 350+ Dutch/English translation mappings
- 4 responsive breakpoints
- Sub-second global TTFB via Vercel Edge Network

## 3. Architecture

### Rendering Pipeline

```
Browser Request
      |
  Vercel Edge CDN (cached response or origin fetch)
      |
  Next.js App Router
      |
  FramerIframe.tsx (React Server Component)
      |
  Renders Framer HTML inside sandboxed iframe
      |
  translate.js loads inside iframe:
    1. Language detection (localStorage)
    2. Translation sweep (NL -> EN if toggled)
    3. CSS injection (responsive alignment, typography)
    4. Branding and targeted DOM fixes
    5. Video/runtime support for non-baked sections
```

### Why This Architecture?

- **Framer** provides designer-quality visual output with complex animations and layouts
- **Next.js** adds SSR (SEO), server-side API routes (contact form), and TypeScript safety
- **FramerIframe** bridges the two: serves static Framer HTML while Next.js handles routing and metadata
- **translate.js** is now primarily a runtime support layer for translations, responsive fixes, and remaining targeted DOM corrections. The English homepage no longer depends on it for the premium intro, benefit video, process section, or studio clips.

## 4. File Structure

### Source Code (`src/`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/layout.tsx` | Root layout: HTML head, fonts, metadata |
| `app/page.tsx` | Homepage — renders FramerIframe with `index.html` |
| `app/components/FramerIframe.tsx` | Core component: iframe wrapper with responsive resize and error handling |
| `app/api/contact/route.ts` | POST endpoint: parses form data and sends email via Resend |
| `app/works/page.tsx` | Experiences index route |
| `app/works/[slug]/page.tsx` | Dynamic routing for case study pages |
| `app/globals.css` | Global styles and iframe base rules |

### Runtime Engine (`public/translate.js`)

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ensureHomeDocxIntroStyle()` | Hero section styling for the baked premium intro block |
| `ensureHowWeWorkStyles()` | "How we work" grid styling and alignment support |
| `ensureHomeBenefitVideoStyles()` | Benefit section spacing and width alignment support |
| `ensureCaseStudyHeroTitleStyles()` | Case study page hero titles |
| `ensureResponsiveLayoutStyles()` | Cross-section responsive CSS (mobile/tablet/desktop) |
| `interceptContactForm()` | Contact form DOM interception → `/api/contact` |
| `injectLangToggle()` | NL/EN language toggle (inside nav flex row) |
| `enforceRegisteredBranding()` | Trademark enforcement (Empower Your Core, EYC) |
| `framerCdnBlocker()` | Blocks external Framer CDN asset requests |

### Static Pages (`public/`)

| Page | File | Lines |
|------|------|-------|
| Homepage | `index.html` | 622 |
| Contact | `contact.html` | 584 |
| Pricing | `pricing.html` | 582 |
| Personal Training | `works/personal-training.html` | 648 |
| Our Method | `works/our-method.html` | 566 |
| Teacher Training | `works/teacher-training.html` | 554 |
| About Us | `works/about-us.html` | 550 |
| 6 Case Studies | `works/*.html` | ~600 each |

---

## 5. Responsive Design System

The layout uses a **mathematical alignment system** with the hero card as the width reference:

| Breakpoint | Viewport | Content Width | Side Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Mobile | < 810px | `calc(100vw - 65px)` | 32.5px |
| Tablet | 810px - 1023px | `min(980px, 100%)` | 64px padding |
| Desktop | 1024px+ | 980px max | 64px padding |

**Key principle:** All sections (benefit, how-we-work, testimonials, footer) must align to the hero card edges. The runtime engine enforces this via CSS injection.

For the English homepage, the structure is now **HTML-first** and the runtime layer should be treated as support, not as the source of truth for the section markup.

---

## 6. Homepage Editorial Heading Guardrail

The three homepage section headings below must always keep the same premium editorial treatment:

- `Ons aanbod` / `What we offer`
- `Hoe wij werken` / `How we work`
- `Ervaringen van onze cliënten` / `Hear from our clients`

Required visual treatment:

- `font-style: normal`
- `Inter Display`
- tight editorial tracking
- original gold gradient / text fill preserved

Intentional contrast:

- the introductory sentence above each section may remain italic
- the section heading itself must stay upright and non-cursive

Do not revert these headings to Framer's italic default. When that happens, the block stops reading like a premium heading and starts reading like body copy.

Implementation note:

- Framer renders these areas as combined rich-text blocks
- the heading is often the **last paragraph** in the intro block
- if styling regresses, fix the last paragraph specifically in `public/translate.js` rather than styling the whole block as italic

---

## 7. Bilingual System (NL/EN)

- **Storage:** `localStorage` key `eyc-lang` (`"nl"` or `"en"`)
- **Toggle:** 40x40px button inside the navigation bar, grouped with hamburger menu
- **Translation:** 350+ entries in `nlToEnMap` object within translate.js
- **Mechanism:** On page load, if `eyc-lang === "en"`, a text node walker replaces Dutch strings with English equivalents
- **Scope:** All visible text including headings, paragraphs, buttons, navigation, footer

### Changing the Default Language

The default language is set on **line 58** of `public/translate.js`:

```js
// Line 53-59 of public/translate.js
var eycLang = (function() {
    try {
      var stored = localStorage.getItem(EYC_LANG_KEY);
      if (stored === "en" || stored === "nl") return stored;
    } catch(e) {}
    return "en";   // ← Change to "nl" for Dutch default
})();
```

- If the user has previously chosen a language via the toggle, `localStorage` wins
- If no preference is stored (first visit), the fallback value on line 58 is used
- To make the site Dutch by default: change `return "en"` to `return "nl"`
- No other files need to change — the toggle, translations, and DOM walker all adapt automatically

### Language-Dependent Social Links

The Instagram link changes based on the active language (line ~837 of `translate.js`):

| Language | Instagram Profile |
|----------|-------------------|
| NL (Dutch) | [instagram.com/empoweryourcore.nl](https://www.instagram.com/empoweryourcore.nl/) |
| EN (English) | [instagram.com/empowerbymo](https://www.instagram.com/empowerbymo/) |

This is automatic — no manual switching needed. When the language changes, all Instagram links on the site update accordingly.

## 8. Contact Form Architecture

```
User submits form (Framer HTML)
      |
  interceptContactForm() captures submit event
      |
  Extracts fields from DOM: name, email, phone, message
      |
  POST /api/contact (Next.js API route)
      |
  route.ts validates fields
      |
  Resend API sends email to studio
      |
  Returns success/error to client
```

**Required environment variable:** `RESEND_API_KEY`

**Setup:** Create a free account at [resend.com](https://resend.com) (3,000 emails/month free tier), verify the domain `empoweryourcore.nl`, generate an API key, and add it as `RESEND_API_KEY` in Vercel environment variables. Full step-by-step guide in README.md.

**Recipient address:** Configured in `src/app/api/contact/route.ts` in the `to:` field of the Resend API call.

## 9. Development Commands

```bash
yarn install          # Install all dependencies
yarn dev              # Development server (port 3000, hot reload)
yarn build            # Production build (static generation + SSR)
yarn start            # Start production server
npx vercel --prod     # Deploy to Vercel production
```

---

## 10. Cache Management

`translate.js` is the most frequently updated file. To bypass browser caching after changes:

1. Update the version string in all HTML files:
   ```html
   <script src="/translate.js?v=YYYY-MM-DD-vX" defer></script>
   ```
2. `next.config.ts` sets `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers for translate.js
3. `vercel.json` sets no-cache headers for HTML files

---

## 11. Deployment Pipeline

**Recommended stack:** GitHub (version control) + Vercel (hosting) — both free tier.

```
git push origin main  →  Vercel webhook  →  Auto build + deploy  →  Live (< 60s)
```

**Setup:**
1. Push this repo to a private GitHub repository
2. Connect the repo to Vercel at vercel.com
3. Add `RESEND_API_KEY` as an environment variable in Vercel dashboard
4. Point `empoweryourcore.nl` DNS to Vercel nameservers
5. Enable automatic deployments (Vercel deploys on every push to `main`)

**Current `vercel.json` setting:** `git.deploymentEnabled: false` — change to `true` to enable auto-deploy on push. Or keep `false` for manual-only deploys via `npx vercel --prod`.

**Headers configured:**
- `translate.js`: `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
- `*.html`: `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`

## 12. Video Assets

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `Intro_Video.mp4` | `public/assets/` | Hero section background video |
| `Outro_Video.mp4` | `public/assets/` | Footer section background video |

**Note:** These files are large and may be gitignored. Verify they exist in `public/assets/` before building or deploying.

## 13. Maintenance Guide

### Adding a New Case Study Page

1. Export the page from Framer as static HTML
2. Save to `public/works/new-page-name.html`
3. Add the slug to the route map in `src/app/works/[slug]/page.tsx`
4. Add Dutch text entries to `nlToEnMap` in `translate.js` for English support
5. Update the version string in the new HTML file's script tag

### Updating Translations

1. Open `public/translate.js`
2. Find the `nlToEnMap` object (~line 60)
3. Add new Dutch → English key-value pairs
4. Bump the version string in all HTML files

### Updating Homepage Content (EN Repo)

1. Update `public/index.html` first for homepage content and structure
2. Keep `translate.js` focused on translation coverage, responsive CSS, and targeted fixes
3. Only add runtime DOM generation if the section cannot be safely maintained in the base HTML
4. Rebuild with `yarn build` and validate the iframe-rendered page in `yarn start`

### Modifying Styles

The runtime engine injects CSS via JavaScript functions (Section 4 above). Each function targets specific page sections. Modify the relevant function and bump the version string.

### Preserving Premium Home Headings

For `Ons aanbod`, `Hoe wij werken`, and `Ervaringen van onze cliënten`:

- keep the heading itself non-cursive
- keep `Inter Display`
- keep the gold gradient / premium text fill
- only the lead sentence above the heading may stay italic

Because Framer often outputs these as multi-paragraph rich-text blocks, do not style the entire block as italic. Override the heading paragraph specifically.

## 14. Known Considerations

1. **Framer Class Selectors**: Framer generates hashed class names (e.g., `.framer-1pxw2q4`). These may change if pages are re-exported from Framer — verify CSS selectors after re-exports.
2. **Video Autoplay**: Mobile browsers restrict autoplay. Videos are muted by default and use the `playsinline` attribute.
3. **YouTube Embeds**: Case study pages with YouTube videos require `pointer-events: auto` and `opacity: 1` overrides due to Framer's default styling.
4. **Source-of-Truth Split**: In this EN repo, the homepage is partially HTML-first. Update `public/index.html` first for homepage copy/structure, then update `translate.js` only where translation coverage or runtime support still depends on it.
