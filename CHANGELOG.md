# Changelog

All notable changes to the Empower Your Core website are documented here.
This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Hardened the English homepage so the premium intro, benefit video, process section, and studio clips now live in `public/index.html`
- Reduced homepage runtime generation by turning `translate.js` into a support layer for those baked sections

### Documentation
- Refreshed the repository handover documentation for client delivery
- Clarified the current Vercel deployment mode and local preview workflow
- Updated cache management guidance for `translate.js` versioning
- Aligned the security documentation with the headers and audit commands currently used in the project
- Documented the new HTML-first maintenance workflow for the English homepage
- Added an explicit homepage typography guardrail so `What we offer`, `How we work`, and `Hear from our clients` stay non-cursive while the intro lead lines can remain italic
